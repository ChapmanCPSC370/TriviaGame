#GameApp
The original project was just a c# console  application that took in data from a text file, and made a simple trivia game. 
I wanted to add a gui component to this project because not much else can be done with a console. My overall intention with this
project is to make it an application with different games available. My main goal first is to add a gui counterpart to this game. Part of that process will include creating different trivia formats. For example, if the user wants to play a trivia game, they will have the option of choosing between a jeopardy style game, a memory style game, or a timed version. Other goals for this application are to create other games as part of this application. Using .Net Framework 4.5.
